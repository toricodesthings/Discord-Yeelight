Discord Bot Utilizing Yeelight Python Library (Local Only)

This is an extremely simple bot and a fun little project of mine that uses YeeLight python library. The bot can be added to servers of your choosing. However, it requires that you run this bot on a server/computer with LAN Access to the Yeelight Bulbs or Lightstrips.

Notes:
- Create a discord bot here -> https://discord.com/developers/applications and input your token in the env file. KEEP THIS TOKEN A SECRET! 
- Please enable LAN Control in the YeeLight App (Important)
- Be sure to have both dot-env and yeelight library installed. Please install both these libraries if you do not have it. **Check the "Links" section for the link to said libraries.**
- Do not forget to edit the user editable area in the .py file, changes will be made to this soon.
